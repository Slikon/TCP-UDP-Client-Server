# TCP-UDP-Client-Server
KPI University study project for TCP/UDP Client-server implementation.
This project explicitly shows the process of creating TCP and UDP client-server connection and sending data between them.

**WARNING!** The amount and type of data being sent between client and server (both TCP and UDP) are given me by the task. It's not my choice, so take it as a simple example.

## Local installation
**(IMPORTANT!)** To install this project on your local device, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be already installed.

1) First you need to clone this repository to your local device using the following command:
```
https://github.com/Slikon/TCP-UDP-Client-Server
```
2) Run the following command to install all the dependencies needed for the project:
```
npm install
```
3) To run the whole project (both TCP and UDP servers and clients at the same time) run `npm start`
4) Run `npm run tcp` to separately start TCP server/client and `npm run udp` to separately start UDP server/client communication. 

**That's it!**
Hope you enjoyed and found it useful.
